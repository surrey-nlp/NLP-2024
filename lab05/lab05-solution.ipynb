    "# Lab 07 - Transformers\n",
    "The lab is adopted from the [popular PyTorch sentiment analysis tutorial by bentrevett](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-sentiment-analysis/blob/master/6%20-%20Transformers%20for%20Sentiment%20Analysis.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will be using the transformer model, first introduced in [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) paper. Specifically, we will be using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model from [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) paper. \n",
    "\n",
    "Transformer models are considerably larger than anything else covered so far. As such we are going to use the [transformers library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) to get pre-trained transformers and use them as our embedding layers. We will freeze (not train) the transformer and only train the remainder of the model which learns from the representations produced by the transformer. In this case we will be using a multi-layer bi-directional GRU, however any model can learn from these representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, it's important to note that transformer models like BERT come with their own pre-trained tokenizers. These tokenizers are specifically designed to work seamlessly with their respective models, ensuring that the text input is appropriately formatted before being fed into the model. This includes tokenizing the text into tokens understood by the model, adding necessary special tokens, and converting these tokens into their corresponding ID numbers from the model's vocabulary. As a result, we do not need to perform manual tokenization or vocabulary mapping steps, which significantly simplifies the preprocessing pipeline. By leveraging these integrated tokenizers, we ensure that our text data is processed in a manner that is fully compatible with the transformer model's requirements, allowing us to focus on fine-tuning the model for our specific sentiment analysis task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, different transformer models utilize distinct tokenizers tailored to their architecture and training paradigms. For instance, models such as LLaMA (https://medium.com/@vyperius117/understanding-the-llama2-tokenizer-working-with-the-tokenizer-locally-using-transformers-2e0f9e69d786), GPT-4(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE&si=qXbrvMZSqPlwdKT6), and Mistral(https://keras.io/api/keras_nlp/models/mistral/mistral_tokenizer/) each come with their specialized tokenizers. One notable tokenizer that is widely used across various models is the SentencePiece tokenizer. Unlike traditional tokenizers that operate on the word level and may struggle with languages without clear word boundaries, SentencePiece tokenizes text at the subword level. This approach allows for a more flexible handling of unknown words, better preservation of linguistic information, and improved model performance across diverse languages. SentencePiece does not rely on pre-tokenization and works directly on the raw text, making it highly versatile and effective for a wide range of NLP tasks."
